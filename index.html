	<h2>Let's Code!</h2>
	<p>HackitMac is a student club at McMaster University for those who are interested in learning, building, and experiencing with different technologies. We are your friendly and "kinda-geeky" student tech club on campus. We hold weekly <a href="/workshops/">workshops</a> that introduce and teach you to coding, and we organize trips to <a href="/hackathons/">HACKATHONS</a> all around Canada and the U.S.</p>
	<p>We organize our very own hackathon <a href="http://deltahacks.com">Deltahacks</a> every year.</p>

	<p>So? Did you know that it will literally take you about 10 mins to have your first website up and running - and we will show you how! The whole point of this community is to go around and experiement and build using all the cool tech we read about at companies like Google and NASA.</p>

	<h3 class="article-title">So what is "Hacking", "Hackathon" ...?!</h3>
	<p>A Hackathon is an event where many different groups of individuals come together for 24-36 hours to build on whatever they please. Hackathons may have themes or be a free for all coding, and sponsors may also place their own twist on what you can do. A hackathon is about innovation and having fun, so theres no need to be going to a hackthon expecting to be glued to your laptop for the whole time, it's part networking, part having serious fun, part serious coding, and a big part is filling up your swag bag to the fullest. And if this explanation isn't enought to convience you, then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cTd1WbX1o">check out this video from MHacks</a> to see how fun hackathons are</p>
