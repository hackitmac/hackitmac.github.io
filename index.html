<h3>What is a hackathon?</h3>

<p>An event where a bunch of hackers come together in teams with the intention of creating the best type of program (i.e. web app, iPhone app, etc) within a certain period of time. If you do well, you usually end up with job offers, cash money and lots of connections. If you don't do very well, you'll end up with motivation for the next one.</p>
