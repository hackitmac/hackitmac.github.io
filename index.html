	<h3 class="article-title">Hackers, Hacking, Hackathon?</h3>
	<p>A Hackathon is where many different groups of individuals come together for 24-48 hours to code on whatever they please. Hackathons may have themes or be a free for all coding, and sponsors may also place their own twist on what you can do. A hackathon is about innovation and having fun, so theres no need to be going to a hackthon expecting to be glued to your laptop for the whole time, it's part networking, part having serious fun, part serious coding, and a big part is filling up your swag bag to the fullest. And if this explanation isn't enought to convience you, then you can always talk to one of us about how fun a hackathon is.</p>

	<p>Hackers will hack, and busing the hackers to the events will be left up to HackItMac, a list of hackathons that HackItMac is participating in is listed <a href="/hackathons/">HERE</a> so <a href="http://hackitmac.us8.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=b39abc3012380d4819ccf3750&amp;id=b127ba37b0" target="_blank">join our mailing list</a> to stay posted with all the ones we're going to.</p>

	<h3 class="article-title">Is your experience neccessary?</h3>
	<p>NOPE. We just would like if you have a open mind, and an affinty to learning new things then you will fit in perfectly with the hackathon culture.</p>

	<p>Since the technology is very saturated with different technologies we would suggest coming to our <a href="/events/">WORKSHOPS</a> so you have an idea of where to start. So taking a look at our <a href="/resources/">resources page</a> would be a great place to start.</p>
