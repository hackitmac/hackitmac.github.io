	<h2><i class="fa fa-laptop"></i> Hackathons</h2>
	<p>A Hackathon is where many different groups of individuals come together for 24-48 hours to code on whatever they please. Hackathons may have themes or be a free for all coding, and sponsors may also place their own twist on what you can do. A hackathon is about innovation and having fun, so theres no need to be going to a hackthon expecting to be glued to your laptop for the whole time, it's part networking, part having serious fun, part serious coding, and a big part is filling up your swag bag to the fullest. And if this explanation isn't enought to convience you, then you can always talk to one of us about how fun a hackathon is.</p>
